* Install the [python](https://www.python.org/) [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/) module.
  ```script
  pip install pre-commit
  ```
* Install the pre-commit hooks into your local repository (this is not tracked remotely and is per repository).
  ```script
  pre-commit install
  ```
* The [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/vmug-labs/vmug-labs/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml) will then enforce certain coding standards so that reviews are simpler.
